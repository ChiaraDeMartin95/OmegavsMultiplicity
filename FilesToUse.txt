*On hyperloop:
produce derived data using the task https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2Physics/blob/master/PWGLF/Tasks/cascqaanalysis.cxx
Derived data to be saved in: /data/dataalice/cdemart/Run3Analyses/OmegavsMult/DerivedData

*On the gr3srv server:
Run on derived data with the task https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2Physics/blob/master/PWGLF/Tasks/cascpostprocessing.cxx
Workflow is in: O2/scripts/script_cascpostprocessing.sh
json file is: O2/cascpostprocessing_Run3Data.json
Script to change json file and run multiple times with different configurables: O2/scripts/script_cascpostprocessing.sh
Python macro which changes json file: O2/json_config.py 

*Post processing locally:
/Users/mbp-cdm-01/Desktop/AssegnoRicerca/Run3Analyses/OmegavsMult

*Post processing on server (only for running macro YieldFit.C):
/data/dataalice/cdemart/Run3Analyses/OmegavsMult

YieldsVsPt.C : fit to inv masses + spectra (saved in Yields directory)
Takes in input the files in OutputFilesCascPPTask

PseudoEfficiency.C : compute PseudoEfficiency
Takes in input files in Yields directory

CompareYields.C : compares mean values, sigmas, purity and yields obtained with different selections
Takes in input files in Yields directory

CompareAntiParticles.C : compares mean values, sigmas, purity and yields of particle and anti-particle
Takes in input files in Yields directory

YieldEffCorr.C : correct raw yields by efficiency and compare them with published ones
Takes in input files in Yields directory and in Efficiency directory

PlotSpectraRatios.C : plots spectra in multiplicity classes + ratio to MB one
Takes in input files in Yields directory

YieldFit.C (to be run on gr3srv): fit the pt spectra (+ plots spectra + fits + ratio data/fit) and plots pt-integrated yields vs multiplicity classes
Use the script script_UpLoadToServer.sh to uploaded the desired files to the gr3srv server

CompareYieldFit.C: compare pt-integrated yields vs mult obtained with different fit functions + computes syst. uncertainty

FinalYieldvsMult.C : produces yield vs dNdeta and compares to Run 2 published AnalysisResults

YieldTotalSist.C: compute total systematic uncertainties from different sources
