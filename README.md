# OmegavsMultiplicity

Repository of the macros used to do the omega vs multiplicity analysis in Run3.

Task in O2Physics to produce derived data: https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2Physics/blob/master/PWGLF/Tasks/cascqaanalysis.cxx
Task in O2Physics to process the derived data: https://github.com/AliceO2Group/O2Physics/blob/master/PWGLF/Tasks/cascpostprocessing.cxx

Yields vs pt in different multiplciity intervals are produced by YieldVsPt.C macro

Pseudoefficiency (reco dat / published spectra) are produced by PseudoEfficiency.C macro
